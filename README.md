# SLIC Size Limiter for Image Compression
Was invented to compress my oversized screenshots for easy storage, but can be used on any images.

Input images [PNG, JPG, JPEG]. Output [JPG].

At startup you will be asked for the folder with input data, if you already have it, specify it in the format [C:\Path\To\Your\Folder]. The same with the output data.

If you have only pictures or it is more convenient for you to do everything within the program folder, just skip the questions and run the script without input data. After that you will see the standard folders.

While the script is running, it will show you the progress and the current task. When finished, you will get the overall result of the folder compression and the saved disk space (but don't forget to delete the input data, it is not done automatically).
